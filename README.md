# Web server

This contains all my server magic; I don't know how long this will last.

```bash
# Starts server locally
npm start

# Starts server for production (aggressively restarts when stops)
npm run serve

# Lint using StandardJS
npm test
```

## Brief history

This was originally made just for making the assassin game, but I decided to use this for other server-related things. That's why some parts of the repository/commit history might be a bit off; the repository used to be at https://github.com/Orbiit/assassin/.
